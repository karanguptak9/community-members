            <p className="AboutText">-----</p>
            <p className="AboutText">I was born in 1996 and raised in San Francisco, California. I never really liked school at all while growing up. I just couldn't wait until the day where I did not have to think about school. During my senior year of high school in my AP Calculus class, I learned that I do not like math but, I do like the problem solving aspect of math. When I got to college I had no idea what I wanted to get into as I didn't like any of my classes, but I heard of computer programming from my brother. I always liked computers and technology as they were a mean to aid in people's lives. So I gave that a chance and I stuck with pursuing a computer science degree after realizing that I like problem solving and computers. I know that I am not the best programmer around, but I put in a lot of effort in my projects and try to get better.

            <p className="AboutText">
              Besides school and studying, in my free time I like to cook random food dishes that I find interesting, performing archery, and just having some time to do nothing. I feel like many of these activities doesn't require too much thinking after the initial thought and planning, so I believe that is why I enjoy these activities so much.
            </p>
            <p className="AboutText">
              Currently I am a senior in San Francisco State University, and about to graduate. I am currently trying to find out which kind of programming I am most interested in going into. I am trying mobile with mobile space and web in my Internet Application and Designs class.
